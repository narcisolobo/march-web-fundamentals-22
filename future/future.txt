Git and Github
Git is version control software. It allows us to keep track of changes in a code base (or repository).
GitHub is cloud storage for our Git repositories. Facilitates working with others on the same project.

1. Go to the root directory of your project. cd 
2. Initialize a repository. git init
3. Add files and/or folders to the repo. git add .
4. Make a commit with a message (taking a snapshot with a caption) of your code in its current state. git commit -m "initial commit"
